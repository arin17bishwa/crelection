The total list eligible voters can also  be pre selected to remove illegal votes.Here it has been added as "btech_cs_2019.sqlite3".
Votes once cast can't be changed and each user can vote only once.Who votes who is not stored in the database.
The total votes is a non-editable field,so it can't be changed manually.
